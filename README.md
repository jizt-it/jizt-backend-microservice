### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not currently maintained ‚ö†Ô∏è
The Jizt backend proved to work great under a distributed, microservices architecture. For over one year, it was hosted on Google Cloud (GKE) powered by Kubernetes and Kafka. However, the implementation of the architecture on its own actually took most part of our development time, and due to our limited resources, slowed down the arrival of new features.

With this in mind, we decided to migrate the Jizt backend to a simpler monolithic architecture in order to focus our efforts on our main goal: provide a great summarization tool. Since we still don't have that many users the new architecture should work just fine. Nevertheless, we'll never say we won't come back to a distributed approach! ;)

<h3 align="center">AI Text Summarization in the Cloud</h3>
<br/>

Jizt makes use of the latest advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), using state-of-the-art language generation models, such as Google's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a> model, to provide accurate and complete abstractive summaries.

## Jizt in 86 words

üìÑ Jizt generates abstractive summaries, i.e. summaries containing words or expressions that do not appear in the original text. In addition, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the summary, such as its length or the generation method to be used.

üì° Jizt provides a REST API supported by a backend that implements an event-driven microservices architecture (Kubernetes + Apache Kafka), in order to provide scalability and high availability. The REST API documentation is accessible via [docs.api.jizt.it](https://docs.api.jizt.it).
