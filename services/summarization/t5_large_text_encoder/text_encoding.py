    sentences.

        To avoid going over the maximum sequence length of the tokenizer, the text is first
        split (without splitting sentences) into groups containing approximately the same
        number of tokens.

        Args:
            text (:obj:`str`):
                The text to be tokenized.
            prefix (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to 'summarize: '):
                String to be added at the beginning of each subdivision.
            truncation (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.TruncationStrategy`, `optional`,
            defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Activates and controls truncation. Accepts the following values:

                * :obj:`True` or :obj:`'longest_first'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument
                  :obj:`max_length` or to the maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not
                  provided. This will truncate token by token, removing a token from the longest sequence in the pair
                  if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
                * :obj:`'only_first'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument :obj:`max_length` or to
                  the maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided. This will only
                  truncate the first sequence of a pair if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
                * :obj:`'only_second'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument :obj:`max_length` or
                  to the maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided. This will only
                  truncate the second sequence of a pair if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
                * :obj:`False` or :obj:`'do_not_truncate'` (default): No truncation (i.e., can output batch with
                  sequence lengths greater than the model maximum admissible input size).
            max_length (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
                Controls the maximum length to use by one of the truncation/padding parameters.

                If left unset or set to :obj:`None`, this will use the predefined model maximum length if a maximum
                length is required by one of the truncation/padding parameters. If the model has no specific maximum
                input length, truncation to a maximum length will be deactivated.
            return_tensors (:obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.TensorType`, `optional`,
                            defaults to 'pt'):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

                * :obj:`'pt'`: Return PyTorch :obj:`torch.Tensor` objects.

                .. note::
                    TensorFlow :obj:`tf.constant` and Numpy :obj:`np.ndarray` objects are not yet supported.

        Returns:
            :obj:`List[int]` or :obj:`torch.Tensor`: The tokenized ids of the text, split into groups, i.e.::

                [[ids_first_subdivision],
                [ids_second_subdivision],
