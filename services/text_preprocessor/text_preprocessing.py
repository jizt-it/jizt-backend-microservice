class TextPreprocessor:
    r"""Text pre-processing utilities.

    This pre-processor carries out the following preprocessing tasks over
    the texts:

    * Removes characters such as :code:`'\n'`, :code:`'\t'`, etc.
    * Adds one whitespace after each sentence (relevant for the BART model).
    * Splits the text into sentences, taking into account Named Entities and
      special cases such as:

      - "I was born in 02.26.1980 in New York", "As we can see in Figure 1.1.
        the model will not fail.": despite the periods in the date and the
        Figure number, these texts will not be split into different sentences.
      - "Mr. Elster looked worried.", "London, capital of U.K., is famous
        for its red telephone boxes": the pre-processor applies Named Entity
        Recognition and does not split the previous sentences.
      - "Hello.Goodbye.", "Seriously??!That can't be true.": these sentences
        are split into: :code:`['Hello.', 'Goodbye.']` and
        :code:`['Seriously??!', 'That can't be true.']`, respectively.
